	abstract  ="Despite the fact that quantitative experimental data have been available for more than forty years now{,} nematoacoustics still poses intriguing theoretical and experimental problems. In this paper{,} we prove that the main observed features of acoustic wave propagation through a nematic liquid crystal cell – namely{,} the frequency-dependent anisotropy of sound velocity and acoustic attenuation – can be explained by properly accounting for two fundamental features of the nematic response: anisotropy and relaxation. The latter concept – new in liquid crystal modelling – provides the first theoretical explanation of the structural relaxation process hypothesised long ago by Mullen and co-workers [Mullen et al.{,} Phys. Rev. Lett.{,} 1972{,} 28{,} 799]. We compare and contrast our proposal with an alternative theory where the liquid crystal is modelled as an anisotropic second-gradient fluid."
